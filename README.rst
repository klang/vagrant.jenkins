vagrant.jenkins
===============

Vagrantbox for `Jenkins`_ on `Ubuntu`_ 14.04 with `Ansible`_ as provisioner.

This will setup a Ubuntu 14.04 - 32 bit server with Jenkins and Apache. The network is bridged, you can change that in the Vagrantfile.

This is written for `Debian`_ and `Ubuntu`_ , the Makefile will most likely **not work** on other OS's, same goes for the virtualenv setup.

Features
========

- Makefile for easy setup
- provioning is done via `Ansible`_
- uses `hostupdater`_

Dependencies
============

- virtualenv [we use the one from the Ubuntu repos]::

    sudo apt install python-virtualenv

- `VirtualBox`_
- `Vagrant`_

Installation
============

Install/Setup jenkins.vagrant like that::

    git clone https://github.com/leftxs/vagrant.jenkins.git

Run Makefile::

    make bootstrap
    source bin/activate

This will setup a virtualenv in vagrant.jenkins and will install Ansible via pip

If you don't want to use the Makefile you can also do it from hand::

    virtualenv --python=python2.7 .
    source bin/activate
    pip install ansible
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater

Now work with vagrant as usual::

    vagrant up

You can get now a cup of coffee or something else, because that will take a while....
After the building is done you can browse to $IPOFVBOX and should see Jenkins
